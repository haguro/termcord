# termcord

`termcord` is a terminal session recorder written in Go.

## Features and usage
`termcord` is still a *work in progress* and currently only supports minimal functionality.

To start a recording session (session will be written to a file named _termcording_)

```
$ termcord
```

To preview a recorded session:

```
$ cat termcording
```

The aim is for termcord to match and expand upon functionality of tools like `script`.
